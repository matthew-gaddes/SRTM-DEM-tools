    Given lons and lats (integers), make a multi tile DEM from either SRTM1 or 3 data.   Note that there are two approached used for masking water bodies in the DEM.  For large DEMS, the mask must be calculated on a tile by tile basis 
    (or it becomes painfully slow, or exceeds RAM requirements), but for small DEMS it can be much faster to create the DEM, crop it (e.g. to a 20x20km size), and then calculate the mask.  
    This decision is made by determine_masking_stratergy

                              2) 'west', 'east', 'south' 'north' bounding edges, in degrees.  
                                  west | -179 -> 180 | west of GMT is negative

                                  south | -90 -> 90  | northern hemishpere is positive
                                  north | -90 -> 90  | northern hemishpere is positive
        SRTM1_or3 | string | either use SRTM3 (~90m pixels) or SRTM1 (~30m pixels)
        water_mask_resolution | None or string | If not none, the DEM will be returned as a masked array, with water masked.  
                                        Resolution of vector coastlines: c l i h f   (ie coarse down to fine)
        SRTM1_tiles_folder | Path | folder where SRTM1 .hgt file are kept
        SRTM3_tiles_folder | Path| folder where SRTM3 .hgt file are kept
        
        ed_username | string | Earthdata username, to apply: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/earthdata-login
        ed_password | string | Earthdata password
        download | boolean | if False, function will not try to download DEM tiles.  Good if have a large number of tile already downloaded.  
        void_fill | boolean | If true, will try to linearly interpolate across voids in data.  
        gshhs_dir | Path or None | Path to directory of the GSHHS shorelines.  Available from: http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/
    
    Output:
        dem | rank 2 array | the DEM, usually as a masked array with water bodies masked, but if resolution is "none" then this is just a numpy array.  
        lons_mg | rank 2 array | The lons of each pixel in the DEM.  Product of np.meshgrid
        lats_mg | rank 2 array | The lats of each pixel in the DEM.  Products of np.meshgrid.  
    History:
        2020/04/?? | MEG | Much of this was written during Covid-19 lockdown for a project work with Strava file.  
        2020/09/21 | MEG | Update to handle non-integer extents (ie. teh western edge need no longer be an integer).
        2020/09/30 | MEG | Change format so that DEMs can be specified as either a centre and side length, or as before as bounds (west, east, south, north)
        2020/10/01 | MEG | Fix a bug in the lats_mg that was causing the lowest lats to be on the top row.
